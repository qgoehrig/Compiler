Definition next token is longest sequence which is a token

Recognition problem:
Given sequence determine kind of token

Grouping problem:
The character group which forms next token.

Describe sequence which are of given token type.

Regular Expressions
    - algebraic notation to represent set of sequences
Definition: use induction to define regular expression (R.E.)
    have:
        l is a R.E. for l in SIGMA
        NIL is a R.E.
        LAMBDA is a R.E.
    inductive step:
        if alpha and beta are R.E.
        then so are (alpha union beta), (a ^ b), (a)*

        Definition: For a R.E the val(a) is the set of sequences
        represented by a and is defined by induction on a

        base:   val(l) = { "l" }
                val(NIL) = NIL
                val(LAMBDA) = {""} = {LAMBDA}

        inductive:  Given val(a) and val(b)
            val(a UNION b) = val(a) U val(b)
            val(a^b) = {w | w = uv where u in val(a) and v in val(b)}
            val(a*) = {LAM} U val(a) U val(a^a) U val(a^a^a)...

Are R.E sufficient enough to decide sets of token seq's.
ex.     identifiers: (Aa...zZ)^ { Aa...Az0...9}*
decimal integers:    [1...9^(0...9)*] U 0
        float:       [1...9^(0...9)*]^.^(0...9)*
reserved words:      b^e^g^i^n
operators:           -U+

Set of States, Alphabet, Initial State, Final States,Transition Funct

An FSA has a set of sequences that it accepts.


Given FSA A we define
run(s, w) = state reached starting at s and following w.
{
    run(s, LAM) = run(s)
    run(s, u^l)

}
